## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript vanilla

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything in particular, but I did get a lot of reminders about DOM manipulation, how to retrieve the value of an input, add or remove a CSS class from an HTML element, retrieve an HTML element, listen to events, etc...
It's a perfect exercise to brush up on some Javascript basics.

### Continued development

Continue to integrate more and more javascript into challenges until ending up using a framework or library.
